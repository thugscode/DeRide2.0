=== LEXICOGRAPHIC MAXâ€“MIN FAIRNESS FOR RIDESHARE ===
Drivers: 100, Riders: 500, Graph nodes: 156, edges: 410
Using R_upperbound = 5 (min(num_riders, max_seats)).
Phase t=1: max number of drivers with load >= 1 is 78
Phase t=2: max number of drivers with load >= 2 is 74
Phase t=3: max number of drivers with load >= 3 is 66
Phase t=4: max number of drivers with load >= 4 is 64
Phase t=5: max number of drivers with load >= 5 is 63
Final tie-breaker optimal.
